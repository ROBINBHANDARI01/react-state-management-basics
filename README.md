# ⚛️ React Fundamentals: State & Interactivity

This project serves as my **official entry point into React development**. It focuses on the transition from static HTML/JS to dynamic, component-based UI development using modern tools.

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives
The goal of this project was to master the "Bread and Butter" of React:
- **Component Architecture:** Breaking the UI into reusable sections.
- **Vite:** Leveraging modern build tools for a faster development workflow.
- **The Hook System:** Implementing logic inside functional components.

## 🛠️ Technical Concepts Implemented
- **`useState()` Hook:** Managed application state to create a truly "reactive" experience where the UI updates instantly.
- **`onChange` Event Handling:** Captured real-time user input to update state and synchronize data across components.
- **Two-Way Data Binding:** Ensuring the input field and the state stay perfectly in sync.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains all React components and logic.
- `App.jsx`: The main entry point where State is managed.
- `CSS Modules`: Implemented for scoped, maintainable styling.
